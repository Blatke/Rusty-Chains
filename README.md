# Rusty-Chains
A mod of HS2/AI-Shoujo Studio Items and Accessories with dynamic bones.

Download the .zipmod file on [Release](https://github.com/Blatke/Rusty-Chains/releases) page.

Can check this [video](https://youtu.be/ePZt0g6xEEc) for demonstration.

Use HS2PE/AIPE's advance mode to adjust the parameters of the chains' damping, elasticity and stiffness.

Use Dynamic Bone Capsule Collider, a studio item built in HS2PE/AIPE, to collide the chains.

Can enable the chains' FK function to manually manipulate the pose, and it suggests to use MoveController to batch select and rotate FK nodes. (Only available for studio items.)

Use MaterialEditor to adjust the chains' base color and emission color.
